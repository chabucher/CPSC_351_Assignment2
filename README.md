# Schedulers - CPSC 351: Assignment2
#

Implements a simulated OS scheduler, using multiple scheduling algorithms, namely, FIFO, LIFO, Round-Robin.

Demonstrates knowledge of OS schedulers & popular scheduling algorithms. Output provides easy analysis of which scheduler works best in which scenario (i.e., many short processes, many long processes, mixed, etc..)

Significant portion of code modified/used from Professor Justin Okun of California State University Fullerton, Spring 2017, CPSC 351.

Code meant to be compiled and ran on Ubuntu Mate, i386 32-bit OS.
"Make" creates the executable: assignment2.
