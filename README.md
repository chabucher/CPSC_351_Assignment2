# Schedulers - CPSC 351: Assignment2
#

Implements a simulated OS scheduler, using multiple scheduling algorithms, namely, FIFO, LIFO, Round-Robin.

Demonstrates knowledge of OS schedulers & popular scheduling algorithms. Output provides easy analysis of which scheduler works best in which scenario (i.e., many short processes, many long processes, mixed, etc..)

Various portions of code (primarily function prototypes) modified/used from Professor Justin Okun of California State University Fullerton, Spring 2017, CPSC 351.

Code meant to be compiled and ran on Ubuntu Mate, i386 32-bit OS.

"Make" creates the executable: schedulers
